codeguide
=========

Codeguide is a search engine designed for programmers. It is a fully extensible framework with a ranking algorithm, features and an interface optimized specifically for finding methods/functions relevant to a coder's programming language, libraries and versions. Codeguide is a work in progress, it will initially roll out with a search function in Python but it is able to be extended to include any number of additional languages/libraries with minimal coding.
